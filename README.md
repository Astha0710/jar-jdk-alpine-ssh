# jar-jdk-alpine-ssh
The image has an init script which replaces SSH_PORT variable in the /etc/sshd_config file while the container is coming up.
In order to test it:
Build the Image:

docker build -t war-ssh-test .

Run the container:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 2222:2222 -e SSH_PORT=2222 --name war-ssh-test test


The SpringBoot application should be running on port 8080 now.
Test SSH:
ssh root@localhost -p 2222
